    Parameters
    ----------
    structure : str
        The crystal structure of the alloy (e.g., "fcc", "bcc", "hcp").

        The size of the supercell to generate (e.g., (2, 2, 2) for a 2x2x2 supercell).
    composition : dict
        A dictionary specifying the composition of the alloy (e.g., {"A": 0.5, "B": 0.5} for a 50-50 binary alloy).
